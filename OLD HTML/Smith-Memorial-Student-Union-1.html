                </h3>
                    This project will at the very least renovate a large portion of the Smith Memorial Student Union building. Alternatively, a demolition could occur and a new building could be built on the same site. Building a new building on the current site could potentially open up new opportunities for local buisnesses to lease and new spaces for students to meet and lounge in.

                    Opportunities
                </h3>
                    Partial to complete renovation or rebuilding of this important campus building. Complete renovation or new construction would reimagine building, providing a modern student facility that addresses the Park Blocks and creates a retail presence on Broadway, greatly improving PSU's image. May include student support services as well as traditional student union functions.
