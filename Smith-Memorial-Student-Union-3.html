                    This project will at the very least renovate a large portion of the Smith Memorial Student Union building. Alternatively, a demolition could occur and a new building could be built on the same site. Building a new building on the current site could potentially open up new opportunities for local buisnesses to lease and new spaces for students to meet and lounge in.

                    Partial to complete renovation or rebuilding of this important campus building. Complete renovation or new construction would reimagine building, providing a modern student facility that addresses the Park Blocks and creates a retail presence on Broadway, greatly improving PSU's image. May include student support services as well as traditional student union functions.
